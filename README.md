# Frontend Mentor - Intro component with sign up form

![Design preview for the Intro component with sign up form coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## WELCOME! ðŸ‘‹

This is a challenge proposed by the website **[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)** and this site is great because it helps us improve our **coding skills** with real projects and more varied difficulties. The site gives us the possibility to train any skill or web technology that we want, be it media-querie, grid layout, Jquery, React, etc..

## The Challenge ðŸŽ¯

This challenge is to reproduce this **Intro component with sign up form** as close as possible to the original design.

My biggest difficulty in this challenge was being able to validate the form using JavaScript, as I took Gustavo Guanabara's JavaScript course some time ago and the course doesn't cover very advanced concepts, but I also don't use js much in my projects. But I intend to evolve a lot with this language.

## Technologies Used ðŸ§©

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Media-queries
